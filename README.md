From the list of tasks from SemEval-2024, we will be working on task 3, subtask 1, slot 1. Namely Competition of Multimodal Emotion Cause Analysis in Conversations, with subtask and slot defined as:

Subtask 1: Textual Emotion Cause Analysis in Conversations
In Subtask 1, an emotion cause is defined and annotated as a textual span.

Slot 1: Emotion Cause Extraction Extracting the corresponding textual cause spans given a target emotion utterance in a conversation. As shown in Figure 1, given the Joy emotion in Utterance 3 (U3), the system needs to extract the cause that triggers this emotion in terms of a textual span, i.e., U2_“You made up!”.
